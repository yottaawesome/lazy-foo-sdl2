# Lazy Foo' Productions' SDL2 tutorial

## Introduction

My in-development walkthrough of Lazy Foo' Productions' [SDL2 tutorial](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php). All code that has been copied remains the copyright of Lazy Foo' Productions, and is simply reproduced here as part of my learning process.

## Using this code

The SDL2 binaries and headers have been included in this repository. For a clean set-up of a project with SDL2, please consult [lesson one](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/msvc2019/index.php). Where I've deviated from the tutorials, by making my own changes, I've added a `README.md` to each relevant project that outlines these deviations.
